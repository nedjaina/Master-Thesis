/*
Basic logistic diagnostics (residuals, leverage, and DFBETAs) do not indicate any undue influence of individual observations, and re-estimating the models while dropping single countries leaves the main results unchanged, suggesting that the findings are not driven by outliers or single country leverage.

/*
To assess the final model's model fit, I first conducted a Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test using ten quantiles of the predicted probabilities. The test yields Chi-X(8) = 9.98 with a p-value of 0.266, providing no evidence against the null hypothesis of adequate fit. The model does not display systematic deviations between observed and predicted values. I then examined the model's discriminative performance using the ROC curve. The area under the curve, >AUC<, is 0.765, indicating a very solid ability to distinguish between voters and non-voters.

While the overall coefficient for EPL was not statistically significant, the marginal effect on the probability of voting showed a significant effect for status-based labor market dualization. This suggests 
that the relationship between EPL and voting behavior is conditional on contract type.

estat classification 

/*
The classification table reveals that the model correctly classifies 84.5% of all cases. The model demonstrates high sensitivity (98.4%), correctly identifying nearly all voters, but low specificity (10.9%), meaning it  struggles to identify non-voters. This pattern is typical for models with 
unbalanced dependent variables, where 84% of respondents reported voting.  The positive predictive value of 85.4% indicates that when the model predicts  voting, it is correct in the majority of cases.
*/



/*
Three nested logistic regression models were estimated with clustered standard errors. Model comparisons show nearly identical fit across specifications (Pseudo R ≈ 0.144), with Wald tests indicating that adding EPL does not significantly improve model fit (p = 0.992 for main effect; p = 0.288 for interaction). The final model demonstrates good fit. Hosmer-Lemeshow test Chi X (8) = 9.98, p = 0.266; AUC = 0.765 84.5% correctly classified. Robustness checks confirm stable results. While overall EPL coefficients are not statistically significant, marginal effects analysis suggests a conditional relationship between EPL and voting behavior depending on contract type.
